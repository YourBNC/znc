##Introduction##

__YourBNC__ is a IRC Bouncer service which is based around you, and only the people.

Our current custom version of ZNC is designed to increase our security, improve performance, improve stability, and improve functionality.

All our staff and server details can be found on our [__website__](https://yourbnc.co.uk).
We are available to contact via [__these methods__](https://yourbnc.co.uk/contact.php).
For more info, please visit our [__GIT page__](https://yourbnc.co.uk/git.php).

You are welcome to edit our code directly (pull requests!), and if we feel it will benefit the service then we will push it to all our working operations.
